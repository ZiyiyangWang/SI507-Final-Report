['Sunny and quiet 2BR, located near beautiful parks and woodland', ' Arbor Hills, Ann Arbor', '$1,265', "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nRENT CONCESSION: If you sign the takeover lease before 12/24, rent will be reduced by $100 a month, so rent will be $1,165/mo until June 2023.\n\nSAVE up to $1,250 at move-in! This is a lease takeover from Jan 2023 to June 2023 with renewal option. This is a 2nd floor, south-facing 2BR/1Ba deluxe unit. Since you will be taking over my lease, you SAVE >$200 on rent each month - a similar unit on the complex is currently going for $1,475.\n\nIn addition, you save on these:\n- One-time cat fee ($200 value)\n- Application fee ($100 value)\n- Security deposit is yours to keep ($300 value)\n- Lease assignment fee will be fully covered by me ($500 value)\n- Covered parking spot already paid for till June 2023 ($150 value)\n\nThis means that over the length of the lease, you can save up to $2,510 compared to signing a new lease!\n\nHappy to discuss leaving furniture behind for your use. Walls will be repainted white before your move-in.\n\nCommunity features:\n- Bus route across the street\n- Easy access to U-M, EMU and WCC\n- Wooded picnic areas\n- Cat-friendly\n\nWhat I like about living here:\n- My rent has not increased in 3 years until this year. This year's increase was $60.\n- Management and maintenance are very responsive; I never had to wait very long for problems to be resolved. Same-day resolution is not uncommon - there had been a few occasions where the maintenance tech who lives on-site would come over to address issues within a half hour of my report.\n- Most neighbors are quiet, and the walls insulate sounds well enough that you don't hear next door sounds unless there's a party going on, which is rare. Even then, a TV or music turned up at a reasonable volume would mask the next-door sounds.\n- Sunlight!! Being south-facing, you're getting all the natural sunlight and this makes winter much more bearable.\n- Heat insulation is also good. Never had drafty windows that weren't taken care of quickly. In the summer, it doesn't get as hot because it's not the top floor.\n- You don't have to leave the building to receive deliveries.\n- Cashless app for laundry! It was a very recent install, but great to finally have one. Still accepts coins if that's your thing.\n- Located on near a bunch of shops and businesses within walking distance, and the Rt 4 bus stop is right across the street.\n\nWhat is less great about here:\n- The layout of the unit means almost everyone places their furniture the same way because there's really only one way to do it. This may or may not bother you.\n- The bedroom with two windows gets about 3 degrees colder in the winter than the rest of the house.\n- The bathroom has a window, but no other ventilation, so hot showers can get quite steamy and dampy in there during the colder months. Not enough to cause mold issues though.\n- The floors can get a little creaky and you can feel thuds coming from heavy footsteps from other neighbors, but that's not unique to this place. \n\nIf ad is up, it's still available. If interested, send me an email or DM!\n", 'https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_cCP6EKozI2Oz_0ew09I_600x450.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_cCP6EKozI2Oz_0ew09I_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_1X71g6xn8u2z_0ew0bP_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_308u6PgmK5Mz_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_7nonsFVOu9Bz_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_d56x5Znp9p7z_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_3dag1YFlUkiz_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00101_3O9yq2uQltKz_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_a58GEhOlfZ5z_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_7cc7XGDE4vkz_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_4JF6r4p7xgrz_0CI0t2_50x50c.jpg , https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_grMCOuxYgymz_0ew0bi_50x50c.jpg', 'https://annarbor.craigslist.org/apa/d/ann-arbor-sunny-and-quiet-2br-located/7565483839.html']

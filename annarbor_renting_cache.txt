This includes a mattress (possibly her entire bed), night stand, and desk (which would actually be free). This apartment complex has free parking spaces available as well as one covered spot per unit (so we share use of this, and it’s nice when it snows!). Utilities are not included in the rent, and run between $60-$160 (depending on the season). We share a $30 monthly internet bill. There is a pool along with tennis/basketball courts to use in the summer. :)No pets please. You’d be living with me 36/F, a doula with her own business. I clean the apartment relatively often, and I’m fairly quiet and always respectful of roommate needs/boundaries. I am away on work appointments intermittently throughout the day but like to spend my down time at home, sometimes having friends over -- or working out at LA Fitness, just five minutes away. Also nearby are plenty of grocery stories (Aldi, Plum Market etc.) and more shopping, nature trails, and we are just a short drive to downtown. If interested, please respond with a little about yourself and what you’re like as a roommate.LEASE BEGINS JANUARY 1, 2023.
